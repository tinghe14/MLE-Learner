## Introduction
<a id='intro'></a>
what to expect in a machine learning interview:
- problem-solving/coding: similar to other software engineering coding interviews
- machine learning understanding: focuses on basic ML concepts such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, optimization functions, and the learning process of various ML algorithms
- career discussion: tends to focus on an individual's resume (previous projects) and behavioral aspects such as the ability to work in teams (conflict resolution) and career motivation
- machine learning system design discussion: focuses on the inerviewee's ability to solve an end-to-end machine learning problem and consists of open-ended questions
  - eg:
    - build a recommendation system that shows relevant products to users
    - build a visual understanding system for a self-driving car
    - build a search-ranking system
  - In order to answer such questions, the candidates should consider the following approach.
