# W2: Neural Networks Basic
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

To make implementation easier, it would be convenient to stack X(features) in columns (so do for the Y(output)) feature matrix, X: R[n_x x m_x], output matrix, Y: R[1 x m]
- n_x rows: n_x features
- m_x columns: m_x training samples
### Logistic regression as neural network
### python and vectorization
### programming assignments
