# The Absolute Bare Minimum
<a id='section_2'></a>
### Variables and Data Types
variables don't need to be decleared. Rather, varaibles come into existence when you assign a value to them
important data types:
- integers
- floats(reals)
- booleans(logicals)
- strings
- lists: can store multiple items of different data types inside of them. These items are stored with a fixed and defined order and are easily changeable
- NoneType: only has a single value, None, this is a actual value that can be assigned to variables
    - Note: None is not a default value for values that haven't yet been assigned a value. If users did try to read an unassigned variables, this will result in an error
- tuples
- sets
- dictionaries
### Type Conversion
conversion function: float(), int(), str()
check data type of variables: type()
round(): can be used to convert floating-point numbers to nearest interger
### Basic Operators
operand_a->operator->operand_b=result
arithmetic operators: 
- Except in the case of division (which always yields a float), the result of an operation will be an integer if both the operands are integers. Otherwise, it will be a float.
- addition, substraction, multiplication, exponentiation, division(/), interger divide(//, round down), modulus(%, remainder of division)
- order of precedence:
    - from highest precedence to the lowest one: (), **, * and /, + and -
    - multiple expoentiations are done <span style="color:red">right to left</span>
