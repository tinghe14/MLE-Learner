# Introduction to OOP
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- previous: procedural programming, hard to implement at complex real-world scenario
- OOP concept: a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects 
- OOP can divide a sophisticated program into number of objects that talk to each other 

Anatomy of objects and classes
- a class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects
- objects are a collection of data and their behaviors

User-defined data types
- while primitive data types only focus on modeling the state of the object, user-defined data types can encapsulate the state and its behaviors into a unit
