# Material that I have learnt
1. [GCP in Chinese](https://github.com/tinghe14/apachecn-dl-zh/blob/master/docs/handson-ai-gcp/SUMMARY.md): not clear, waste of time
2. official GCP repo: clear but the docker image part has been outdated
    - [Github repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/main): include information about project setup, docker image creation and sample code of pytorch,BUT container part is too old
    - pytorch code sample using published container and built-in dataset, [tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/main/pytorch/containers/published_container): container/docker image, can think as conda environment locally
    - pytorch code sample using custom container and built-in dataset,[tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/main/pytorch/containers/custom_container): additional docker image creation file
    - pytorch code sample using custom container with hyperparameter tuning and built-in dataset,[tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/main/pytorch/containers/hp_tuning): additional hyperparameter tuning
3. official GCP tutorial: updated but It can't follow
    - [container part](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/getting-started-keras)
    - [Training PyTorch Transformers on Google Cloud AI Platform](https://nordcloud.com/tech-community/training-pytorch-transformers-on-google-cloud-ai-platform/): include [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/packaging-trainer) to packing code to GCP, and [recommended project structure](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/packaging-trainer#project-structure)
4. official Vertex AI tutorial: most updated and clear to follow
    - [Youtube, overview of documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRQXIiNLdAk): use pretrained docker image, create a docker file, and share the skeleton of image file; previous episode contains how to upload local data to cloud storage
        - tutorial - [steps by steps](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkRaWElYeVhSdnNuZS1uUENYZHlqQ1VHeGJtZ3xBQ3Jtc0tremd0WGw0X1VxcTlYMzhfQzg4bkpxaDZfN25jSFZHUDg0bDZyUzRKdHB6bk5VbzYzRkJkQ0RGR1FqcHFOanMzVWdJdS05bF9UNlFsUUlCR0lRTVpqd3ZZQUpvUjRyZnRIV2tmaHVNM3hwNWt1UzFUVQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2F3w7kGvV&v=VRQXIiNLdAk): very useful and clear! pay attention to some linked documentations
            - linked documentation - [base docker image list](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-containers/docs/choosing-container#choose_a_container_image_type?utm_campaign=CDR_sar_aiml_ucaiplabs_011321&utm_source=external&utm_medium=web): create docker file and if we want to use predefined image, this is what should looking for at FROM statement
            - linked documentation - [more about how to create a docker file](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-custom-container#create_a_dockerfile): include not only FROM statement
            - linked documentation - [docker repo which create in the begining if no step was missing](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images#before-you-begin): REPO_NAME statement
            - linked documentation - [Define a variable with the URI of your container image in Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-custom-container#create_a_dockerfile): use this step here instead of steps by steps tutorial. This is more clear.

            - previous code sample - [GCP repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/main/pytorch/containers/published_container): used the tutorial in example 2 followed the part 2 and part 3 code, it can build a docker image and teach how to run locally first
